👋 Hi, I'm Zoë!  
🎓 I'm a master's student in Classical Studies with a passion for digital humanities and ancient languages.  
🧠 I'm especially interested in natural language processing, quantitative textual analysis, and educational tech.  
🔧 Python is my current go-to, but I have experience in C, C#, and Java.  
🧗🏻 In my free time, you'll probably find me building in Minecraft or climbing rocks.
