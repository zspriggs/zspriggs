👋 Hi, I'm Zoë!  (she/her)  

🎓 I'm a master's student in Digital Tools for Premodern Studies.  

🔭 I’m currently working on tools to help researchers without a coding background perform quantitative assessments of ancient texts.  

🧠 I'm especially interested in natural language processing, quantitative textual analysis, and educational tech.  

🔧 Python is my current go-to, but I have experience in C, C#, and Java.  

🧗🏻 In my free time, you'll probably find me climbing rocks or playing Minecraft.
